I'm a first year master student from Tsinghua University (THU), Shenzhen Graduate School. My advisor is [Prof. Yujiu Yang](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/yyj/main.psp). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor's degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University in June 2025.

I am currently interning in ByteDance, focusing on post-training of MLLM for e-commerce scenarios. Prior to this, I interned in TeleAI, working on the post-training of the Telechat series foundation models. I have also interned in Tencent before for kernel development.

My research interest includes Reward Model and LLM/MLLM post training.
